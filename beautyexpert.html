          Beauty Expert is a web app that quickly connects a user to a beauty specialist through real-time video calls. During the conversation, users explain their problem and receive personalized advice from an expert. Video call can be saved and watched later.

        <p>
          The project was created in 4 months during the UX design course. The design thinking process was applied to the project in order to create user-friendly solutions. Following the principles of the user-centered approach, I performed generative research of the target audience to understand their needs and goals. I implemented the findings into an interactive prototype that was tested by potential users and made iterations based on testing results.
        </p>
        <h3>01 Research</h3>
        <p>
          We are overwhelmed by fashion and beauty advices on the internet, and still people struggle to find what is the right fit for them. It seems that even though certain makeup style looks amazing on the presented model, when you try to do it yourselves, the outcome is different than expected.
Every person has different qualities and they need personalized approach that will help them establish their own unique style. Creating an application that quickly connect users with experienced beauty professionals in order to receive beauty advice will help the users create the look they want.
        </p>
        <p>
          User interviews were conducted to better understand potential users’ needs and motivations to use online tools in the search for a solution to their style-related problem. The goal of the research was documenting users' opinion about existing online tools that provide an expert answer to the user's question and gathering information about users' expectations when contacting an expert, regarding the type of questions, scheduling and trust in their expertise.
        </p>

        </picture>
        <p>
          Key insights: Busy schedule doesn’t allow users to spend a lot of time dealing with style-related problems, so they need a short and concise answer to their question. Users want to receive video messages or save video calls so they can watch it again. There is a possibility to advertise products within the app since the users would appreciate recommendations from the experts. To gain trust in their expertise, users need to see expert’s certificates and previous experience as well as the reviews from previous customers. The app should be professional looking, accessible, inexpensive and easy to use.
        </p>
        <h3>02 Define</h3>
        <p>
          Based on results of research analysis, I created user personas that represent target audience.

        <h3>03 Ideate</h3>
        <p>
          User journey and user flow were created to define the most important actions user would do to accomplish their goals using the app.To organize IA structure, I designed a sitemap of the app.

        <h3>04 Prototype & Test</h3>
        <p>
          Using rapid prototyping I created low-fidelity wireframes to demonstrate the key functions of the app. Paper prototype was subjected to usability testing with four participants, which revealed main pain points and frictions. Improvements were implemented in mid-fidelity prototype created based on testing results.
        </p>

        </picture>
        <p>
          Iterative process led to interactive high-fidelity prototype, created with Adobe Xd and InVision tools. Moderated in-person and remote usability testing with six participants were carried out to test the usability and functionality of the app.
        </p>
        <p>
          To organize information gathered in the testing, I used Rainbow spreadsheet. I identified challenges and errors participants made while performing tasks using the app, ranked them by severity and suggested changes.

        <h3>05 Refine</h3>
        <p>
          As part of refining the design I determined a design language system to maintain consistency in the user interface throughout the app. I applied the guidelines for accessible web content to ensure accessibility of the app.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Through design process I realized the importance of continuous testing and iterating the prototype according to the testing results. Receiving feedback and solving problems that were identified through research and testing were of great importance in the creation of a product that provides a good user experience.
